Act as a poet and write a poem about a boy dreaming about space.He likes astrophysics, wants to be an astronut and explore space. 
He is in 3rd gradr .It should 2 paragraphs long, rhyming words.

In a small town where the stars brightly glow,
Lives a third-grade boy with dreams that overflow. 

His heart beats for the cosmos, 
so vast and wide, In the realm of astrophysics, 
he takes great pride. He dreams of galaxies, 
of stars that twinkle and blaze,
His mind lost in the universe’s mysterious maze.

He aspires to be an astronaut,
to explore the great unknown, 
To traverse the Milky Way, 
where no child has flown. 
With a telescope in hand and a spacesuit in sight, 
He imagines floating in space, under the moon’s soft light. 
In his dreams, he’s not just a boy, but a celestial ace, 
A brave explorer of the infinite, boundless space.

Act as a poet and write a poem about a boy dreaming about space.

Chain of thought-> he is in class, studing stars and galaxies, he dreams about wearing a space suit ,
meeting elon musk, launch of rocket, into the universe, he goes past every planet and into the milkyway, 
he sees the vastness of the universe and thinks about every theory, he is spiritually moved but his scientific brain cannot fathom the feeling, 
science vs god? what is real ? he undergoes an existential crisis and questions what reality truly is

In his third-grade class,
under the fluorescent light, 
He studies stars and galaxies,
oh, what a sight! 

He dreams of donning a spacesuit,
so sleek and bright, Meeting Elon Musk,
under the moon’s soft light. 

The rocket’s launch, 
the roaring might, 
Into the universe, 
he takes flight, 
Past every planet,
into the Milky Way’s night,
The vastness of the cosmos, 
a breathtaking sight.

He ponders every theory,
every cosmic rite, 
His heart is moved, 
his spirit takes flight.

Yet his scientific mind, 
in its analytical might, 
Struggles to fathom this spiritual height.

Science versus God? What is right? 
An existential crisis, in the starry night. 

What is real? He questions,
in the satellite’s light,
In the vast universe, 
he seeks his true sight.
